# **Universal Setup (Required for All Versions)**

**Everyone must do this step first.** To use the tool efficiently, you need specific futures data from CoinAlyze.

1. Go to https://CoinAlyze.net and sign up.

2. Navigate to **Custom Metrics** and tap on **Create Custom Metrics**.

3. Enter **VTMR** in the Name and Short Name fields, then paste the **VTMR code** below in the Expression field and save & close.

```code
((vol_1d[0] / mc_1d[0]) * 10) / 10 * (vol_1d[0] / mc_1d[0] >= 0.5)
```

- Go to **Columns**, deselect all, and select **Market Capitalization**, **Volume 24H**, **Open Interest Change % 24H**, **Predicted Funding Rate Average, OI Weighted**, and **VTMR**, then click **Apply**.

- Bookmark the page and save it as VTMR.

- Go to Chrome menu → Share → Print, and save it as it is without changing the file name in the Download folder.

### Why Do This?

Because before you run the toolkit, you need fresh futures data from CoinAlyze. 

So basically, you only need to launch Chrome  → type VTMR and open it  → print the page into the Download folder. 

**For the web-based version**, you'll upload it and save at **Get Futures** page before running advanced analysis.

If you are using **Standalone local environment v3.0 or v4.0**, then after you run the toolkit, it will take care of cleaning your download folder and leaving only the most valuable reports there.
